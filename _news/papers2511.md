Two papers from my postdoc were published this week! A [JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-025-09744-7) on relative security for reasoning on spectre-like vulnerabilities in Isabelle/HOL, and an [iFM 2025 paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-10794-7_7) on model checking buffered durable linearizability for concurrent data structures in non-volatile memory environments.
