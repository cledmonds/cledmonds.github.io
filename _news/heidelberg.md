I was invited to give a talk on Formalised Mathematics in Isabelle/HOL at Heidelberg University as part of their [Research Seminar series on Formal Mathematics](https://matematiflo.github.io/FormalMathSeminar/SS2025.html). Thank you to Florent Schaffhauser and Judith Ludwig for hosting - exciting to also hear about some of the current work in that group and to continue to see formal maths becoming a central part of mathematics departments!
