I attended the 11th Heidelberg Laureates Forum at the end of September - an amazing week of learning, networking, and great conversations. As part of the event, I was also selected to be one of 30 young researchers to participate in the "Poster Flash" session, a cool opportunity to present my PhD work in a new and widely accessible way. My two minute flash talk from the session is [available online]( https://youtu.be/1-aTRGvJzPQ?si=HJKdD1_ovm994_zl&t=2070).
