abstract = {Formalised libraries of combinatorial mathematics have rapidly expanded over the last five years, but few use one of the most important tools: probability. How can often intuitive probabilistic arguments on the existence of combinatorial structures, such as hypergraphs, be translated into a formal text? We present a modular framework using locales in Isabelle/HOL to formalise such probabilistic proofs, including the basic existence method and first formalisation of the Lov\'{a}sz local lemma, a fundamental result in probability. The formalisation focuses on general, reusable formal probabilistic lemmas for combinatorial structures, and highlights several notable gaps in typical intuitive probabilistic reasoning on paper. The applicability of the techniques is demonstrated through the formalisation of several classic lemmas on the existence of hypergraphs with certain colourings.},

abstract = {We describe our formalisation in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL of the Balog–Szemer\'{e}di–Gowers Theorem, a profound result in additive combinatorics which played a central role in Gowers’s proof deriving the first effective bounds for Szemer\'{e}di’s Theorem. The proof is of great mathematical interest given that it involves an interplay between different mathematical areas, namely applications of graph theory and probability theory to additive combinatorics involving algebraic objects. This interplay is what made the process of the formalisation, for which we had to develop formalisations of new background material in the aforementioned areas, more rich and technically challenging. We demonstrate how locales, Isabelle’s module system, can be employed to handle such interplays in mathematical formalisations. To treat the graph-theoretic aspects of the proof, we make use of a new, more general undirected graph theory library developed by Edmonds, which is both flexible and extensible. In addition to the main theorem, which, following our source, is formulated for difference sets, we also give an alternative version for sumsets which required a formalisation of an auxiliary triangle inequality. We moreover formalise a few additional results in additive combinatorics that are not used in the proof of the main theorem. This is the first formalisation of the Balog–Szemer\'{e}di–Gowers Theorem in any proof assistant to our knowledge.},

This paper presents a modular approach to formalising designs for the first time using Isabelle and assesses the usability of a locale-centric approach to formalisations of mathematical structures. We demonstrate how locales can be used to specify numerous types of designs and their hierarchy. The resulting library, which is concise and adaptable, includes formal definitions and proofs for many key properties, operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs.},

  abstract = {The formalisation of mathematics is continuing rapidly, however combinatorics continues to present challenges to formalisation efforts, such as its reliance on techniques from a wide range of other fields in mathematics. This paper presents formal linear algebraic techniques for proofs on incidence structures in Isabelle/HOL, and their application to the first formalisation of Fisher’s inequality. In addition to formalising incidence matrices and simple techniques for reasoning on linear algebraic representations, the formalisation focuses on the linear algebra bound and rank arguments. These techniques can easily be adapted for future formalisations in combinatorics, as we demonstrate through further application to proofs of variations on Fisher’s inequality.}

	abstract = {Meltdown and Spectre are vulnerabilities known as transient execution vulnerabilities, where an attacker exploits speculative execution (a semantic optimization present in most modern processors) to break confidentiality. We introduce relative security, a general notion of information-flow security that models this type of vulnerability by contrasting the leaks that are possible in a ``vanilla''semantics with those possible in a different semantics, often obtained from the vanilla semantics via some optimizations. We describe incremental proof methods, in the style of Goguen and Meseguer's unwinding, both for proving and for disproving relative security, and deploy these to formally establish the relative (in)security of some standard Spectre examples. Both the abstract results and the case studies have been mechanized in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover. This paper is an extension of an earlier conference paper that provides significantly more detail on the Isabelle formalization and the unwinding proof process.},

abstract="Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a high-performance memory technology that supports persistency (i.e., durability) of data in case of a system crash (e.g., power failure). For implementations of concurrent objects (e.g., concurrent data structures such as stacks and hash maps), NVM poses a correctness problem: can the implementation recover to a consistent state after a crash and continue execution? In this paper, we study a notion of correctness known as buffered durable linearizability for implementations of periodically persistent concurrent objects, and develop a refinement-based proof method for buffered durable linearizability. To support our proofs, we develop a generic abstract specification of a buffered durable linearizable object that is generated from the object's sequential specification. Our main case study is a concurrent hash map known as Dal{\'i}, which we show satisfies buffered durable linearizability. Specifically, we use FDR, a model checker based on CSP, that offers a fully automatic method for checking trace refinement.",
