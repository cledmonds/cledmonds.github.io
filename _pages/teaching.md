### Current Teaching
At Sheffield, I've been a Teaching Assistant for the following courses: 
- Software Hut (capstone software engineering group project)
- Logic (also guest lecturer)

I was also a lecturer at the Midlands Graduate School in 2025, see the course web page [here](/mgs2025).

### Past Teaching
At Cambridge, I supervised (i.e. small group tutoring) for four colleges on a number of different courses:
- IB Logic and Proof (Lent 2020/2022/2023)
- IA Discrete Mathematics (Michaelmas 2020/2021, Lent 2020/2021/2022)
- IA Algorithms (Lent 2021)
- IA Software and Security Engineering (Easter 2021/2022)
- IB Semantics (Michaelmas 2021/2022)

I was additionally a secondary supervisor for a summer research internship.

At the University of Queensland I was a tutor/demonstrator for three courses:
- CSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering (2015 - 2017)
- CSSE2002: Software Engineering in the Large (2017)
- MATH1061: Discrete Mathematics (2014 - 2016)

### Teaching Qualifications and Awards

I'm an Associate Fellow with AdvanceHE (awarded in 2022). I'm happy to provide my teaching portfolio on request. In the same year, I was delighted to be awarded the [Silvia Breu Teaching Prize](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/news-and-events/the-silvia-breu-teaching-prize-in-computer-science) for best Computer Science Supervisor at Queens College, thanks to nominations by my fantastic students.

### Outreach

At Cambridge, I was a Session Leader for Computer Science and Mathematics as part of the centrally run Outreach program. I delivered a number of online and in-person introductory lectures for high school students on research related topics. I was also the Mentoring and Outreach co-chair for Women@CL, and helped out with department run events. 

Previously, I was heavily involved in [Robogals](https://robogals.org/), a global organisation aiming to inspire and empower young women to consider studying engineering and related fields. Prior to taking on a leadership role in the organisation, I designed, led, and helped out with over 80 workshops using LEGO Mindstorms in schools across Queensland.
