I greatly enjoy teaching and have been consistently involved in teaching throughout my time in academia. 

At Sheffield, I'm currently a Teaching Assistant for the following courses: 
- Software Hut (capstone software engineering group project)
- Logic (also guest lecturer)

At Cambridge, I supervised (i.e. small group tutoring) for four colleges on a number of different courses:
- IB Logic and Proof (Lent 2020/2022/2023)
- IA Discrete Mathematics (Michaelmas 2020/2021, Lent 2020/2021/2022)
- IA Algorithms (Lent 2021)
- IA Software and Security Engineering (Easter 2021/2022)
- IB Semantics (Michaelmas 2021/2022)

I was additionally a secondary supervisor for a summer research internship.

At the University of Queensland I was a tutor/demonstrator for three courses:
- CSSE1001: Introduction to Software Engineering (2015 - 2017)
- CSSE2002: Software Engineering in the Large (2017)
- MATH1061: Discrete Mathematics (2014 - 2016)

I'm an Associate Fellow with AdvanceHE, and am currently a thesis mentor at the University of Sheffield - aiming to further develop my research supervision skillset.
