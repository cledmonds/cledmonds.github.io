### Current Teaching

##### Undergraduate Teaching

In 2026, I'll be a lecturer on the following courses:
- Object Oriented Programming (CITS2005)
- Computational Thinking with Python (CITS1401)

##### Honours Projects

If you are a UWA honours student interested in doing a project on formal verification (e.g., verifying something in an interactive proof assistant, or building tooling to support the use of such software), please feel free to get in touch! See the honours course project website for possible projects (coming soon!).

##### PhD 

If you are interested in doing a PhD in formal verification, it'd be great to hear from you! FIRST READ [THIS ADVICE](/prospectivephd). 

##### ANU Logic Summer School

I will be a Lecturer at the [ANU Logic Summer School](https://comp.anu.edu.au/lss/) in December 2025. Course web page coming soon!

- Software Hut (capstone software engineering group project)
- Logic (also guest lecturer)

##### Cambridge University

I supervised (i.e. small group tutoring) for four colleges on a number of different courses:
- IB Logic and Proof (Lent 2020/2022/2023)
- IA Discrete Mathematics (Michaelmas 2020/2021, Lent 2020/2021/2022)
- IA Algorithms (Lent 2021)
- IA Software and Security Engineering (Easter 2021/2022)

##### Research Schools

I was a lecturer at the [Midlands Graduate School](https://www.andreipopescu.uk/MGS_Sheffield/MGS2025.html) in 2025, see the course web page [here](/mgs2025).

### Teaching Qualifications and Awards

I'm an Associate Fellow with AdvanceHE (awarded in 2022). I'm happy to provide my teaching portfolio on request. In the same year, I was delighted to be awarded the [Silvia Breu Teaching Prize](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/news-and-events/the-silvia-breu-teaching-prize-in-computer-science) for best Computer Science Supervisor at Queens College, thanks to nominations by my fantastic students.

### Outreach

At Cambridge, I was a Session Leader for Computer Science and Mathematics as part of the centrally run Outreach program. I delivered a number of online and in-person introductory lectures for high school students on research related topics. I was also the Mentoring and Outreach co-chair for Women@CL, and helped out with department run events. 

Previously, I was heavily involved in [Robogals](https://robogals.org/), a global organisation aiming to inspire and empower young women to consider studying engineering and related fields. Prior to taking on a leadership role in the organisation, I designed, led, and helped out with over 80 workshops using LEGO Mindstorms in schools across Queensland.
