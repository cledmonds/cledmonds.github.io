I completed my undergraduate studies from 2012 to 2017 at the University of Queensland, Australia, graduating with First Class Honours and a University Medal from a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) and Bachelor of Science (Mathematics). As part of my degree, I completed a highly commended honours thesis in formal methods and studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh. Between 2017 - 2019, I was a Software Engineer for Boeing Australia working on advanced prototyping projects. While my time at Boeing was an invaluable experience in software engineering, I found myself missing the opportunities to explore more theoretical concepts as well as my teaching work. 

This led me to commence my PhD at Cambridge in 2019 after being awarded a prestigious [Cambridge Australia Scholarship](https://www.cambridgeaustralia.org.au/). At Cambridge, I was privileged to be supervised by Prof. Lawrence C. Paulson, and a member of the [ALEXANDRIA](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/) project group team investigating large scale formal proof for the working mathematician. I submitted my thesis in September 2023, and passed my viva in January 2024 (currently awaiting final approval of the degree). As a passionate educator, while at Cambridge, I also aimed to develop my teaching skillsets, eventually becoming an Associate Fellow with [AdvanceHE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/), and being awarded the [Silvia Breu teaching prize](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/news-and-events/the-silvia-breu-teaching-prize-in-computer-science) in Computer Science at Queens College.

Beyond my research work, I have been involved in a leadership capacity for many organisations and initiatives. In Cambridge, I was President of the [Darwin College Student's Association](https://www.dcsa.darwin.cam.ac.uk/) in 22/23, after a previous term as Sports and Societies Officer. In this role, I represented Darwin's 800 postgraduate students on the college council and wider Cambridge student association, was a member of a university committee on postgraduate mental health, and supported a 22-person student team to organise a variety of social, well-being, and networking events and initiatives around college. I additionally was involved in the University's outreach programs as a [Session Leader](https://www.cao.cam.ac.uk/pgoutreach/sessionleaders), giving lectures on various topics in mathematics and computer science to senior school students, and was the Mentoring and Outreach Officer for [Women@CL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/women) for two years.

Prior to Cambridge, one of my most significant roles was as the APAC Regional Executive Officer for [Robogals](https://robogals.org/) from 2015 to 2018, an international not-for-profit inspiring girls to pursue careers in STEM fields. I initially joined Robogals as a volunteer (and later President) for the local Brisbane chapter in 2012, motivated by a desire to help other girls like me discover the possibilities engineering careers present. As an undergraduate, I was involved in several other ambassador and mentoring programs. In 2017, I was honoured to be selected for the [Qld Women in Technology](https://wit.org.au/) Young Achiever Award and [GradConnection Top100 Future Leader Australia](https://au.gradconnection.com/top100/future-leaders/2017/) Software Engineering Prize in recognition of these efforts.

Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, cycling, writing, and music. I have a diploma on the violin, and am a member of the [Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra](https://sheffieldphilharmonicorchestra.org/).
