I am very open to hearing from prospective PhD students! If you would like to reach out to me as a potential PhD supervisor, please first: 
- Take a look at my research interests (on this website and my UWA Research profile).
- Look over my publications and projects (you probably want to read at least one recent paper).
- Think about why you want to do a PhD (there are many great blogs on this!)
- ... and consider if your interests for possible PhD topics align with my interests!

When you reach out, it'd be useful for me to know:
- What research experience do you already have (e.g. honours projects, masters, papers etc)?
- What relevant courses have you completed in mathematics, formal methods, verification, programming languages etc?
- Any initial ideas you have for research directions. 
- If you'd like, a link to a personal website, linkedin profile, or github page is also welcome. Please do not attach anything to an initial email.

Note that PhD scholarships are typically managed centrally at Australian universities, so I'll likely have little direct influence over funding. This [link](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/scholarships-and-fees/scholarships/hdr-scholarships) is a good starting point for an overview of HDR (Higher degree by research) scholarships at UWA.

Generic emails (e.g. that are sent to multiple academics or which do not follow the above advice) will be ignored.
