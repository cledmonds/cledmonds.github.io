Welcome! I'm Chelsea, a Lecturer (equiv. US Assistant Professor) in Computer Science and Software Engineering at the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/physics-mathematics-computing/department-of-computer-science-and-software-engineering). My primary research interests are formalised mathematics, interactive proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL and Lean, modular formal proof techniques, and formal methods for security and concurrency. I'm also interested in exploring new ideas at the intersection of formal methods, HCI, and computing education. 

Previously, I was a Postdoc at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs) working on the [COVERT](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX015114%2F1) project with Dr. Andrei Popescu and Prof. John Derrick (as well as collaborators at Surrey and Kent) -- which aimed to develop verification tools and models for reasoning on the security of programs running on advanced architectures. I was awarded my PhD from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) in 2024, which explored how we can develop modular, flexible, and extensible libraries for combinatorial mathematics in Isabelle/HOL, supervised by Prof. Lawrence C. Paulson. I'm grateful to have been fully funded by a [Cambridge Australia Scholarship](https://www.cambridgeaustralia.org.au/) and a studentship from the Department of Computer Science. My PhD work was further acknowledged by a [British Federation of Women Graduates Academic Award](https://bfwg.org.uk/bfwg2/bfwg-academic-awardees/), and a Distinguished Paper at CPP 2024.

Beyond my research, I'm a passionate educator and an Associate Fellow with [AdvanceHE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/). I've been involved in numerous STEM outreach events and organisations, as well as gender diversity initiatives for Women in STEM.
