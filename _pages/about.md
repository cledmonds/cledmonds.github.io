Welcome! I'm Chelsea, a postdoctoral Research Associate in Verification at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs). My primary research interests are formalised mathematics, proof assistants (particularly Isabelle/HOL), and formal methods for security and concurrency. In my current position, I'm working on the [COVERT](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX015114%2F1) project to develop verification tools and models for reasoning on the security of programs running on advanced architectures. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Prof. Lawrence C. Paulson. My PhD explored how we can develop modular, flexible and extensible libraries for formalised mathematics (particularly combinatorics) in Isabelle/HOL, and the process for mirroring human intuitive proof techniques in a formal environment. I'm grateful to have been fully funded by a [Cambridge Australia Scholarship](https://www.cambridgeaustralia.org.au/) and a studentship from the Department of Computer Science. My PhD work was further acknowledged by a [British Federation of Women Graduates Academic Award](https://bfwg.org.uk/bfwg2/bfwg-academic-awardees/).

Beyond my research, I'm a passionate educator and an Associate Fellow with [AdvanceHE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/). I've been involved in numerous STEM outreach events and organisations, as well as gender diversity initiatives for Women in STEM.
